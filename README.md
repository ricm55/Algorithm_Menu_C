# Here my algorithms menu in C

Here are just a few algorithm that allow me to challenge myself and review some concept in C programming.

For now, there is only 2 tests to make sure the menu works. In the futur, I will add more programs to it.

You can run the program with bin/release/AlgorithmMenu.exe

IDE => Code::Block
